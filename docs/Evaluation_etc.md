## User tests

> What user tests have you done? How did they affect the development of your product?

I have done some thinking out loud tests on both prototypes. They helped me realise some problems with the application and allowed me to adapt and refactor certain parts. They also helped me understand the typical user's behavior when using the app. For example, one of the things that I noticed in a couple of the tests was that people tried pressing on the cards on the home screen expecting something to happen so that is something that I have noted and implemented as issues to be implemented in the future. 

## Graphic profile

> What images did you make, and with what techniques? Where did you find images if you use images that you didn't create? How did you make sure to adhere to copyright laws?ยจรถ

There aren't many images being used except for the SSIS logo that was supplied to me by the school. The icons that are being used in the application are open source and free to use. 

I made the app design in photoshop by making artboards for each screen in the app and then exporting them to jpges for importing in inVisionApp.

## Evaluation of Accessibility

WCAG - how have you made your website accessible?

Because of the fact that my application is a mobile application, I couldn't apply WCAG in the same fashion as I would ona. web application.

## Evaluation of work and product

> What have you learned about the process of making a website? What would you improve for next time? What would you improve about the website itself?  

I have learned to plan my project using a mix of scrum and kanban and trello. I started out creating a backlog and just creating a card for every feature that I could think of. I then started picking out and labeling the features that are necessary for an MVP/release candidate 1. 

I have also learned that designing prototypes in photoshop takes longer than you think. It takes a lot of attention to detail and a lot of trial and error to get things right and the way you want them to be. Furthermore I got to use inVisionApp for the first time for my prototypes and it is definitely something that I will use again in future projects.
